# Twitter Bootstrap for Middleman #

To get started use bundler

    gem install bundler

Clone the repository

    git clone git://github.com/eejjjj82/middleman-twitter-bootstrap.git a-project

Then do the ```bundle install``` to install it all

## TODO: ##

Currently I am just copying this project around as a jumpstart for a middleman site it would be nice to have the following:

* git subtree/submodule integration to the [sass-twitter-bootstrap project](https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap), currently I'm just copying assets
* get the project setup for installation as a gem - see how middle man extensions are installed
* separate out the ScssReroute extension - maybe?
